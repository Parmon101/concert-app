Interactive version concert-2cn9c3s2l-parmon101.vercel.app

Implemented in React + js rtk + react-route .

It works: user navigation with uploading of posts and comments. Send to server, but no update ( because there is a request to the backend which does not write new data to itself )

Use: 
- select User -> view info user and posts
- select Post -> view detail info post with comments
